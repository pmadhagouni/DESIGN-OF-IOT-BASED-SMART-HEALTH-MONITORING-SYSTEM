# **DESIGN-OF-IOT-BASED-SMART-HEALTH-MONITORING-SYSTEM**
This Project is the design and deployment of a smart health monitoring system of a patient. 
The sensors used here are placed on the patient's body to detect their temperature and heartbeat. 
Two extra sensors are installed at home to monitor the humidity and temperature of the patient's room. 
The derived values are subsequently sent to the base station through the cloud. 
These values are then retrieved by the doctor at any location from the base station. 
Thus, based on the temperature, heart rate, and room sensor measurements, the doctor may determine the patient's condition and take suitable treatments.
The derived values are subsequently sent to the base station through the cloud.

## **Objectives**
* To foster constant Health checking framework.
* To examine the patients' real-time data.
* Decreases the intricacy because of the wires.
* Specialists focus on patients and give pressing consideration who are in the most peril in
this manner saving lives.
* To break down and foresee soundness of the patients by means of Machine Learning
Algorithms.
