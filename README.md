# **DESIGN-OF-IOT-BASED-SMART-HEALTH-MONITORING-SYSTEM**
This Project is the design and deployment of a smart health monitoring system of a patient. 
The sensors used here are placed on the patient's body to detect their temperature and heartbeat. 
Two extra sensors are installed at home to monitor the humidity and temperature of the patient's room. 
The derived values are subsequently sent to the base station through the cloud. 
These values are then retrieved by the doctor at any location from the base station. 
Thus, based on the temperature, heart rate, and room sensor measurements, the doctor may determine the patient's condition and take suitable treatments.
The derived values are subsequently sent to the base station through the cloud.

## **Objectives**
* To foster constant Health checking framework.
* To examine the patients' real-time data.
* Decreases the intricacy because of the wires.
* Specialists focus on patients and give pressing consideration who are in the most peril in
this manner saving lives.
* To break down and foresee soundness of the patients by means of Machine Learning
Algorithms.

## **Conclusion**
The real time wireless health care monitoring system is described in this project as a result of
the pursued research effort. This Real Time Health Care Monitoring System prototype was
created and manufactured to wirelessly monitor people's health at any time and take
preventative steps to avert death or disease. Wearable technology is used in this system so that
individuals may feel comfortable without having to add anything to their regular attire that
might make them feel self-conscious.
