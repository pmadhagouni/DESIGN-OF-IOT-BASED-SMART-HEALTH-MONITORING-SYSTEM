# DESIGN-OF-IOT-BASED-SMART-HEALTH-MONITORING-SYSTEM
This Project is the design and deployment of a smart health monitoring system of a patient. 
The sensors used here are placed on the patient's body to detect their temperature and heartbeat. 
Two extra sensors are installed at home to monitor the humidity and temperature of the patient's room. 
The derived values are subsequently sent to the base station through the cloud. 
These values are then retrieved by the doctor at any location from the base station. 
Thus, based on the temperature, heart rate, and room sensor measurements, the doctor may determine the patient's condition and take suitable treatments.
The derived values are subsequently sent to the base station through the cloud.
